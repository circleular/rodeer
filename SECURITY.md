# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As you know, interfering with the Roblox Player can cause security problems, or could get you banned if you push it to an extent. This is a list of the
versions of rodeer which are safe for security and ban protocols. Ban protocols are very unlikely but still plausible, if you do use a version without
ban precautions, be wary.

| Version       | Ban Protocol       | Security            |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1.0.0 (LTS)   | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:  |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Go to my account, @battattack or on somewhere like Twitter (again, @battattack).

### My account got banned, what do I do?
Check your version first. If it did not have the ban precaution then it was your own fault and you shouldn't lie. If, however you did use a ban-precaution-enabled version
please immediately tell me, @battattack either on somewhere like Twitter (again, @battattack), or through an issue on here. It is my job to try my best to fix it and
update the security policy that it does not work. After that, you can go to www.roblox.com/support to contact them and explain the situation, hopefully they will unban
you. I cannot help you further than that.
