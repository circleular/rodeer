# RoDeer: Roblox Customization to the max.
## What is RoDeer?

Imagine Roblox Studio Mod Manager but for the Roblox Player. You can customize sounds, textures- all easily. You can insert .dll files, however only a select few. This is not an injection application, at all. If you're looking for one, you can leave. The .dll files only customize the game to make it feel better- but it will not insert, edit, move or delete any in-game scripts.

## How do I use it?
Go to the releases section in the right-hand toolbar and click on the LTS(Long-Term-Support) and download it. That easy.

## Can I review/change the .dll code?
In short: No. You can see what the code does, however you can NOT change it or look at the actual code. Like I have said, this is not an injection application and I am not allowing people to be able to be able to turn it into that. This may be open-source, however the .dll files are restricted and only changed by me privately.

## Can I edit the code?

Yes, you can. This is an open-source project and so anyone is allowed to edit it as long as it is used correctly. You may fork the repository and change it there, if you want to change it for your own personal use- or if you just don't want to request it. All changes there will not come here, though.

Concepts for it are most certainly allowed, as my UI knowledge is not on point.

## Is this definitely open-source?

To an extent, yes. I am not being paid and not paying anyone who contributes to it, it's all everyone's choice and I'm willing to work solo if no one else wants to help. However, the only thing un-accessable to other people are the .dll files.

## But I really want to edit the .dll files!

If you really are desperate to edit the .dll files, you can use IntelliJ RIDER to view the .dll code. You could edit it from there, however there's a high chance it will break.
